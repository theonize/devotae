`A confession of Christian faith.`


## Structure
The top level of the confession are the highest ideas in Scripture.
The first sub-level breaks down those ideas into smaller chunks.
The second sub-level contains the fragments of truth that are important but incomprehensible without the whole.

## Participation
The intent is to have a public, peer-reviewed text that is useful and edifying to the Church.
Initial content may be just a placeholder but further revisions will be moderated.
